EXERCISE: Use non-parametric bootstrapping to derive a 95% confidence interval for the CV of a variable.
Start by writing a function that computes the CV for a variable (see the Appendix for a brief introduction
to writing functions in R). Then, simulate a random variable and write a loop that samples many times from
this variable and computes the CV.

```{r}

```
