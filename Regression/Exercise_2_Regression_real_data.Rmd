## Load data
```{r}
birds = read.csv("bird_allometry.csv")
head(birds)
```


```{r}
# Split data in males and females
males = birds[birds$Sex=="m",]
females = birds[birds$Sex=="f",]
```


```{r}
#Then, we fit linear models to log-transformed brain- and body-sizes.
mm = lm(log(brain_mass)~log(body_mass), data=males)
mf = lm(log(brain_mass)~log(body_mass), data=females)

```

```{r}
#After checking that the residuals look OK, we look at the model fit #for the males.
hist(residuals(mm))
summary(mm)
```

```{r}
# Females
hist(residuals(mf))
